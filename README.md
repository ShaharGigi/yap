yap - Yet Another Parser
===========

yap is yet another parser written in Go. It was implemented to test the
hypothesis of my MSc thesis on Joint Morpho-Syntactic Processing of MRLs in a
Transition Based Framework at IDC Herzliya with my advisor, Reut Tsarfaty.
A [paper on the morphological analysis and disambiguation aspect for Modern Hebrew
and Universal Dependencies](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1033.pdf) was accepted to COLING 2016

yap is currently provided with a model for Modern Hebrew, trained on a heavily updated
version of the SPMRL 2014 Hebrew treebank. We hope to publish the updated
treebank soon as well.

yap contains an implementation of the framework and parser of zpar from Z&N 2011 ([Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features by Zhang and Nivre, 2011](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-2033.pdf)) with flags for precise output parity (i.e. bug replication), trained on the morphologically disambiguated
Modern Hebrew treebank.

yap is under active development and documentation.

***DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION***

Requirements
-----------
- [Go](http://www.golang.org)
- bzip2
- 4-16 CPU cores
- ~4.5GB RAM for Morphological Disambiguation
- ~2GB RAM for Dependency Parsing

Compilation
-----------
- Download and install Go
- Setup a Go environment:
    - Create a directory (usually per workspace/project) ``mkdir yapproj; cd yapproj``
    - Set ``$GOPATH`` environment variable to your workspace: ``export GOPATH=path/to/yapproj ``
    - In the workspace directory create 3 subdirectories: ``mkdir src pkg bin``
    - cd into the src directory ``cd src``
- Clone the repository in the src folder of the workspace, then:
```
cd yap
go get .
go build .
./yap
```
- Bunzip the Hebrew MD model: ``bunzip2 data/hebmd.b32.bz2``
- Bunzip the Hebrew Dependency Parsing model: ``bunzip2 data/dep.b64.bz2``

You may want to use a go workspace manager or have a shell script to set ``$GOPATH`` to <.../yapproj>

Processing Modern Hebrew
-----------
Currently only Pipeline Morphological Analysis, Disambiguation, and Dependency Parsing 
of pre-tokenized Hebrew text is supported. For Hebrew Morphological Analysis, the input
format should have tokens separated by a newline, with another newline to separate sentences.

The lattice format as output by the analyzer can be used as-is for
disambiguation.

For example:
```
עשרות
אנשים
מגיעים
מתאילנד
...

כך
אמר
ח"כ
...
```

Note: The input must be in UTF-8 encoding. yap will process ISO-8859-* encodings incorrectly.

Commands for morphological analysis and disambiguation:

```
./yap hebma -raw input.raw -out lattices.conll -stream
./yap md -in lattices.conll -om output.conll -stream
```

The output of the morphological disambiguator can be used as input for the dependency parser.
Command for dependency parsing:
```
./yap dep -inl output.conll -oc dep_output.conll
```
